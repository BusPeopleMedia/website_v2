        <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
        <h3>Agora is a global community of stoicism practitioners.</h3>
        <p>
          Our guidelines are meant to build a mutual understanding of what being a part of this community is all about.
          We will take action if any of these guidelines are not upheld, so please read carefully.
        </p>
        <h4>Always be Respectful</h4>
        <p>
          Be respectful of others and where they’re coming from.

        </p>
        <h4>Think before you share</h4>
        <p>
          We care about your safety. Please beware of swapping or posting any private information that could be misused.
          That includes your phone number, age, address, what time you’ll be at home, school name, email, or other
          personal information that could put your privacy at risk. Simply put: don’t over-share. Sharing and
          encouraging others to share personal data might get your post, and possibly your account, removed.
        </p>
        <h3>Please don’t use Agora to…</h3>
        <h4>
          Attack a person or group of people with words and actions
        </h4>
        <p>

          <b> Agora</b> is a safe place for stoic practitioners of all backgrounds. Harassment and hurtful content will
          not be tolerated. Using symbols, names and text that promote hate—as well as harassing, stalking,
          impersonating, and making sexual remarks towards someone—are considered abuse. The same goes for nudity and
          disturbing profile pictures and usernames. As stated in the terms, Agora reserves the right to replace images
          or remove these accounts at its sole discretion. Rule of thumb: if you are making someone feel attacked or
          hurt, then you shouldn’t be doing it. We take these reports seriously and may delete your account without
          previous notice if such activity is verified by our team.
        </p>

        <h4>Write inflammatory comments </h4>
        <p>
          Hateful, obscene and off-topic comments don’t contribute to learning. Cursing doesn’t either (let people
          discover those words in the wild). Leave them out of the language discussions.
        </p>
        <h4>To Summarize</h4>
        <p>
          We do not tolerate content that is:
        <ul>
          <li>Illegal</li>
          <li>Pornographic</li>
          <li>Excessively profane or violent</li>
          <li>Spam</li>
          <li>Threatening, harassing, or bullying</li>
          <li>Associated with racism or intolerance</li>
          <li>Impersonating someone in a misleading or deceptive manner</li>
          <li>Personal confidential information</li>
        </ul>
        </p>


        <p>
          We will remove any content that violates the spirit of these guidelines and you will risk losing partial or
          full access to Agora without warning.
        </p>

        <p>
          Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to disclose Your Personal Data if required to do so

          Security of Your Personal Data</h4>
        <p>
          The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us, but remember that no method of transmission over the
          Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While We strive to use commercially acceptable means
          to protect Your Personal Data, We cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

          Children's Privacy </h3>
        <p>
          Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable
          information from anyone under the age of 13. If You are a parent or guardian and You are aware that Your child
          has provided Us with Personal Data, please contact Us. If We become aware that We have collected Personal Data
          from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, We take steps to remove that
          information from Our servers.</p>
        <p>
          If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information and Your country requires
          consent from a parent, We may require Your parent's consent before We collect and use that information.</p>

            By using or accessing our Services you accept these Terms & Conditions.
            ‍
            Your use of our Services is subject to Agora Privacy Policy, which is an integral part of these Terms &
            Conditions and is available at: https://buspeoplemedia.com/#work.</p>
          <h3>Agora APP</h3>
          <h4>1. General rules</h4>
          <p>
            By using Agora App you are subject to these Terms & Conditions and to any rules or policies applied by any
            App Store provider from whose site you download the App (“Provider”).
            ‍
            We license use of Agora App to you on the basis of these Terms & Conditions. We (or our affiliates and/or
            third party licensors, where applicable) remain the owners of Agora App all times.
          </p>
          <h4>2. App account and Premium subscriptions</h4>
          <p>
            To download and use Agora App you must sign in with your Apple ID or Google ID.
            ‍
            Relevant rules of Apple Inc. and Google Inc. respectively located at: <a
              href="https://www.apple.com/itunes">https://www.apple.com/itunes</a> and <a
              href="https://play.google.com/store">https://play.google.com/store</a> apply. If you use a Provider other
            than listed above, you are subject to the terms and conditions of that Provider. Please contact your
            Provider in connection with any issues regarding your account.
            ‍
            Agora App offers a Premium subscription that grants you access to additional features. You can purchase
            and/or subscribe to Agora Premium or other paid products. By paying the subscription fee you get access to
            Agora Premium during the time your subscription is valid, subject to these Terms and Conditions. All
            subscriptions with Agora Premium are paid in advance. You may at any time terminate your membership, in
            which case your membership will still be valid for the subscription time you have already paid for. You
            hereby consent to start using the Services immediately upon subscribing with Agora Premium or other paid
            products. This means that you will only have 7 days to withdraw from the contract with Agora from the date
            you receive confirmation of your subscription via email if you do not start using the service during that
            period. Agora reserves the right to change the subscription fees from time to time.
            ‍
            Users purchase subscriptions for Agora App through the App Store, the Google Play store, or other Provider
            are governed by the terms and conditions of the Provider. Please contact your Provider in connection with
            any issues regarding payments, renewals and refunds.

            If you have subscribed to Agora Premium through the use of App Store, Google Play Store or any other
            Provider, using in-app purchase, you can only cancel your subscription through the use of their services.
            Apple subscription purchases are handled by Apple Inc. Agora does not have access to your billing
            information and cannot issue a refund. To request refund and with other issues regarding subscription please
            contact Apple Inc. Google Play subscription purchases are handled by Google Inc. Agora does not have access
            to your billing information and cannot issue a refund. To request refund and with other issues regarding
            subscription please contact Google Inc.
            ‍
            You can at any time choose to cancel/end your account by contacting the Provider. Please note that
            uninstalling the mobile application or closing your account will not automatically stop your Premium
            subscription — you must actively cancel the subscription. Please note that if you have subscribed to Agora
            through the use of App Store, Google Play Store, or any other Provider, you can only cancel your
            subscription through the use of their services. To find out how to cancel the subscription and/or your
            account, please follow the instructions in the App or contact your Provider for help.
          </p>
          <h4>3. Age</h4>
          <p>
            Agora App is not directed to individuals under the age of sixteen (16). To use the App, you agree that you
            must be 16 or older. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for Agora to lawfully provide
            the Services to you without parental consent (including using of your personal data) then you must acquire
            this minimum age.
          </p>
          <h4>4. Using the App</h4>
          <p>
            Agora is committed to ensuring that the App is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
            reserve the right to make changes to the App or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason.
            We will never charge you for the App or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re
            paying for.

            It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to Agora App secure. We therefore recommend that you
            do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations
            imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to
            malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the
            Agora App won’t work properly or at all.
            ‍
            Certain functions of the App will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can
            be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider. Agora cannot take responsibility for the App not
            working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data
            allowance left.
            ‍
            If you’re using the App outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement
            with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider
            for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the App, or other third party
            charges. In using the App, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
            charges if you use the App outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data
            roaming.
            ‍

            Although we endeavor to ensure that the App is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
            to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Agora accepts no liability for any
            loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the App.
            ‍
            At some point, we may wish to update the App. The App is currently available on iOS – the requirements for
            systems (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the App to) may change, and
            you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the App. Agora cannot guarantee that it will
            always update the App so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS/Android version that you have
            installed on your device.
            ‍
            We may also wish to stop providing the App, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of
            termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted
            to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the App, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
            ‍
            If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are using the App, please be aware that we assume
            that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the App.
          </p>

            If you access and engage with our App, you will interact with other users who will provide personal support,
            encouragement and motivation. None of the advice provided by users or through the Services should be
            considered medical or clinical advice and none of such information is intended as medical or clinical
            advice. Do not disregard professional medical advice or delay seeking professional advice because of
            information you have received through our Services or received from other users.

            For clarity, only copyright infringement notices should go to our Copyright Agent. You acknowledge that if
            you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this section your notice may not be valid.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you believe the content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you
            have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to
            post and use such content, you may submit a counter-notice to the address listed above containing the
            following information:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Your physical or electronic signature;
            </li>
            <li>
              Identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location
              at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;
            </li>
            <li>
              A statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of
              mistake or a misidentification of the content; and
            </li>
            <li>
              Your name, physical address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the
              jurisdiction of the federal court in the judicial district in which you reside, or if you reside outside
              of the United States, then of the federal court in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and a statement that you will
              accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            After we receive your counter-notification, we will forward it to the party who submitted the original claim
            of copyright infringement. Please note that when we forward the counter-notification, it includes your
            personal information. By submitting a counter-notification, you consent to having your information revealed
            in this way. We will not forward the counter-notification to any party other than the original claimant.
          </p>
          <p>
            After we send out the counter-notification, the claimant must then notify us within 10 days that he or she
            has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity relating to
            the content that was removed or disabled. If we receive such notification, we will be unable to restore the
            material. If we do not receive such notification, we may reinstate the material
